# Altera System Console's RC script
#
# This TCL file is installed as:
#   $HOME/system_console/system_console_rc.tcl
#
# On launch, if this TCL file is found in the above location, System Console
# will call the TCL command "source <this file>" upon entry.  This is intended
# to be a configuration file that allows users to handily source scripts and
# perform commands they would want to set up their System Console environment.
#
# Please edit this script to your preference.
